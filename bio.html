            Hello there! My name is Degena. <br>
            I am a Computer Science masters student at tufts university. I graduated from Colgate University with a BA in computer science. I have 3+ years of professional experience in software Engineering. In my free time I enjoy watching/playing soccer, watching survivor and drinking craft beers.
